# **MuseTalk with Super-Resolution: A Journey**

Upgrading MuseTalk with super-resolution was a fun yet challenging experience. The idea was simple: enhance the resolution of the lipsynced part of the video frames using **GFPGAN** and **CodeFormer**, without touching the rest of the frame. To achieve this, I wrote a script named `x.py` that integrates these models seamlessly into MuseTalk. The script takes a video and audio input, generates a lipsynced video, and enhances the resolution of the generated parts if needed. The workflow is straightforward: MuseTalk generates the lipsynced frames, calculate the resolution difference between the generated and original parts, and if the generated part has lower resolution, apply super-resolution using the selected model. The result is a video with enhanced clarity in the lipsynced areas, providing a significant quality boost.

## **Setting It Up**

I started by cloning the MuseTalk repository and creating a Conda environment named `musetalk_env` for managing dependencies. This helped keep everything organized and isolated from other projects. After installing essential libraries like PyTorch, NumPy, and OpenCV, I encountered my first major roadblock: conflicting library versions.

## **Challenges and Fixes**

One recurring issue was Python throwing a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `musetalk` while running `x.py`. I fixed this by dynamically adding MuseTalkâ€™s parent directory to the `PYTHONPATH` in the script itself. Another challenge was the slow processing time when applying super-resolution to the entire frame. To optimize this, I isolated the generated lipsynced region using bounding boxes and applied super-resolution only to that part. This not only saved time but also ensured the rest of the frame remained untouched, preserving its original quality.

## **How to Run the Script**

The final script, `x.py`, allows you to choose between GFPGAN and CodeFormer for super-resolution. You can run it as follows:  
```bash
python x.py --superres [GFPGAN/CodeFormer] -iv input.mp4 -ia input.mp3 -o output.mp4
```
Replace `[GFPGAN/CodeFormer]` with your preferred model, and provide the input video (`-iv`), input audio (`-ia`), and output video (`-o`) paths. The script checks the resolution ratio between the input and generated frames and applies super-resolution only when necessary.
